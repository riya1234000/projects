# INTRODUCTION
Hi, I’m Riya — a curious and systems-driven student with a growing passion for data analytics and business intelligence. I love working with data to uncover patterns, solve problems, and build tools that make workflows smarter and more efficient.

I specialize in Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python, and Power Query, and I’m currently pursuing certifications to deepen my expertise. My recent projects include dynamic dashboards, automated planners, and clean reporting systems that showcase my skills in advanced formulas, ranking logic, and business-day calculations.

I’m building a portfolio of real-world analytics projects to prepare for internships and launch a career in data analytics. My long-term goal is to help organizations make better decisions through data-driven insights and scalable automation.
